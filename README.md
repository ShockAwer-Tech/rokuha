# What is futabawall?
futabawall is a translation of futaba-ng, which is a rewrite of the old futaba channel software.

The master branch is ye olde translation, achieved by using a combination of futallaby's english strings and google translate (i can't jap at all), however [the features branch](https://github.com/outrunning/futabawall/tree/features) aims to add (as the name implies) more features to make it more like a normal chan. You can also check out [403chan's version](https://github.com/403chan/FutabaWall) for new features as well.

I made the original translation at the request of a friend of mine, however the owner of 403chan came up with the name FutabaWall.

# Instructions
1. Open futaba.php.

2. Edit lines 10-34 (optional, but it's recommended to change the admin password).

3. Upload the 3 php files.

You are done!
